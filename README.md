#Problem Statement 
Classifying Whether a wine is of superior quality or not based on its features and its attributes.
# About the Dataset
The wine data set consists of 13 different parameters of wine such as alcohol and ash content which was measured for 178 wine samples. These wines were grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
# Dataset 
The Dataset used is [Wine Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality) from Kaggle
# Models Used 
## Random-Forest Classification
As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset." Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting
## Support - Vector - Machine
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
